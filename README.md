This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a vector using an index that is out of bounds. The provided code will panic at runtime if an invalid index is used. A solution is presented using `get()` to handle potential errors safely. This is crucial for writing robust and error-resistant Rust code.
